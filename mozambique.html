				<h5>Origin Story</h5>
				<p>Back in 2020, my Uncle Lynn brought up the idea of going on a trip together. He never mentioned the kind of trip, though, so when he and my parents told me I'd be going to a country in Africa to work for a few weeks, I admittedly wasn't thrilled. Over the next few months, my outlook began to shift from underwhelmed to curious to stoked as I got my visa and realized just how crazy this opportunity was. In the end, I was so grateful I went through with it; not only did I meet new people and travel across the world, I helped accomplish something hard that would be a blessing for young kids for years to come. As the cherry on top, my Uncle Lynn signed up to be a parent builder, and three of my cousins joined me as youth builders, too. </p>
				<p>Since our trip, my sister Ashley and some of our other cousins have taken HXP trips to places like Fiji, Romania, Israel, and Samoa; my sister Cassidy just got into the builder's program in Cambodia. The number of available trip sites has increased significantly over the years, so you'll have a wider variety of options to suit your preferences, restrictions, and goals.</p>

				<h5>My Experience</h5>
				  <p>In May of 2021, I traveled for 36 hours, flying from Seattle to Chicago to meet up with the group, then to New Amsterdam for a layover, then landed in Johannesburg, South Africa at midnight. All 24 of us&mdash;two parent builders, two young adult leaders, and twenty youth builders&mdash;then got up early the next morning to take COVID tests and board our bus to the next stop: Kruger National Park.</p>
				  <p>We stayed there for two nights. Our activities consisted of watching African dancing, jumping in the freezing hotel pool, learning about and holding snakes, visiting a butterfly habitat, singing in the Sudwala caves, and of course, an early-morning safari.</p>
				  <p>By the end of the weekend, we'd made it over the border into Mozambique without any hiccups. In the mornings, everyone would wake up for devotional and personal study before grabbing our worksite gear and squishing into a tiny bus for the hour-long drive. Workdays were about seven hours long plus a lunch break; since we were the first group, our jobs included digging the space for the foundation (with half-size shovels), moving cement bricks, mixing concrete by hand, bending rebar, and following the master builder's instructions for putting everything together.</p>
				  <p>As you can see in the bottom right photo, we got to interact with the kids onsite between their classes. We played duck-duck goose, watched them do flips and tricks, learned a few Portuguese words, and taught them some English. They loved running their hands through our hair and braiding it. They already had one building with two classrooms, but some of them had class outside under a tree, hence why we were there. The kids were our favorite part of this experience; on our last day at the worksite, we hugged them goodbye, and some even gave us notes. I still have a note from one of the girls. And more often than not, some of the locals who worked onsite with us needed a ride back home&mdash;so we'd load the bus past capacity and drop them off on our way back.</p>
				  <p>We did different things every evening after working. We had a talent show, a celebration night for those who missed graduation for the trip, a dance class, a trip to an underwhelming mall, a soccer night with some of the locals. Sometimes we had dinner at a restaurant instead of at the hotel, or went to grab ice cream after dinner. The second night, we drove back from one of these activities in a thunderstorm. The trip leader in charge of the music played the song "Africa" by TOTO, which became a core memory for me as we all sang along. The worksite had partially caved from the rain, but even that couldn't quell the enthusiasm and spirit of our purpose.</p>
				  <p>Over the one weekend we had in Mozambique, we drove a ways to Ponta da Ouro on the coast. It was too stormy to scuba dive, so we went for a boat ride in the Indian Ocean and then spent the rest of the day shopping, eating pizza, and playing on the beach. And during our 34-hour travel day back home, we stopped by a McDonald's, the LDS temple, and a bougie mall all in Johannesburg.</p>

				  <h5>Trip Details</h5>
				</a>
				<ul>
				  <li>Each HXP trip has different itineraries, costs, requirements, etc., even from the same destination in years past. Go to their website by clicking this section's title for more up-to-date details.</li>
				  <li>Selecting your trip is not straightforward&mdash;it's a lottery process. You may not get your first choice, but it's hard to go wrong when your goal is to serve others and get out of your comfort zone.</li>
				  <li>International trips range upwards of $3,500 and are 15-18 days, while domestic ones are usually $2-3,000 and about 9 days long.</li>
				  <li>Youth aged 14-19 are welcome to sign up for these trips, though teens under 16 are restricted to the domestic ones. Young adults are encouraged to apply for trip leader positions, especially if they speak another language, but that process is much more competitive.</li>
				  <li>This program is called Humanitarian Experience, so ALL of the trips are phone-free. I brought a camera to take pictures; others brought disposable cameras and Go-Pros. The adult leaders and builders had their phones for pictures, emergencies, and updating the parents about their youth builders through the HXP Mozambique Instagram account. The digital detox was one of my favorite aspects of the trip because it allowed me to fully immerse myself in service and connection.</li>
				  <li>There are different types of trips: building, teaching, summit, refugee, and more.</li>

				<h5>Packing Tips</h5>
				<ul>
				  <li>Check the weather, either through a weather app or a quick Internet search about the typical climate, and plan accordingly. The appropriate attire depends based on your trip type; since mine was a building one and Mozambique was in the 70s, I brought T-shirts, leggings, sports bras, sturdy shoes, gloves, thick socks, and lots of hairties.</li>
				  <li>These trips do require you to go to church on Sundays, so bring at least one casual dress or skirt. A white shirt, tie, and slacks are standard for guys.</li>
				  <li>I received a packing list before my trip, which included niche/required things like a helmet and gloves. HXP keeps you pretty updated about the things you'll need&mdash;especially documents like visas and notaries and passports.</li>
				  <li>Keep in mind that every trip has a bag limit; my trip only allowed one backpack, one carry-on, and one checked bag.</li>
				  <li>Bug spray, sunscreen, sunglasses, warm clothing, some cash, a swimsuit or two, Night/DayQuil, and extra socks and underwear are always good ideas. Some people on my trip even brought malaria pills and such.</li>
				  <li>Again, check the itinerary and packing list HXP gives you and you'll be set. Don't forget any medications you might need.</li>
				  <li>And don't forget your PASSPORT!</li>
				</ul>

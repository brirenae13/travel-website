				<h5>Origin Story</h5>
				<p>Mexico has only ever been a vacation spot for us. My parents first went for their tenth anniversary; about eight years later, they decided to plan a trip that included us four girls, too. I believe my Aunt Keri and Uncle Lynn, who came with us (their two youngest sons in tow), played a part in convincing my parents to book the trip. Another factor in that decision was the stage of life our family was in: they could afford it, and all of us were old enough to remember and appreciate the experience.</p>
				<p> Just the six of us have since visited Mexico 3 more times: Puerto Vallarta once, Cancun once, and then Cabo San Lucas for the second time.</p>
				<p>Keep in mind, the company you travel with will make or break your experience. Do it with the people you love!</p>

				<h5>Memories</h5>
				<p>My favorite memories are the ones not captured by cameras&mdash;we were too busy swimming and laughing and sipping unlimited drinks. Here's a few notable mentions.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>My sisters and I did gymnastics growing up, but in the pool, we tried cheerleading stunts (flipping and crashing into each other included).</li>
				  <li>We tried new foods... well, mainly Cassidy tried the wild ones. I've got some iconic photos that will stay in the vault. A couple experiments involved a whole fried fish and escargot.</li>
				  <li>Our second Mexico trip, we made memes of each other. Mom was not pleased, but everyone else was.</li>
				  <li>Getting ready for dinner, of course, was a rollercoaster. Sometimes it was more yelling "Hurry up!" than helping each other with hair and makeup, but somehow we always made it to dinner more or less without tears.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Resorts: All Beachside and All-Inclusive</h5>
				<p>Each of these resorts have many amenities and perks, including but not limited to spas, shops, gyms, pools, hot tubs, poolside bars, snack shacks, wedding packages, and countless events or activities. Food, drinks, and more are part of the all-inclusive packages, but other amenities vary by resort (and keep in mind that tipping dinner and room service staff is expected). For more details, each hotel name is linked to its corresponding website.</p>

				  <dd>This trip was during COVID, so the hotel was only at 25% capacity. The employees knew who we were and provided excellent service, the balcony rooms were beautiful, and the breakfast buffet had great gluten-free options&mdash;the chef even came out and made whatever my youngest sister asked for. The dinners and room service desserts were delicious, and don't even get me started on the poolside tacos. Ten of us stayed at this resort: our family of six, and my aunt and uncle with their two youngest sons. Everyone loved the experience.</dd>

					<dd>We arrived at this resort on Christmas Day; everything was decorated and everyone was warm and welcoming. We had difficulty finding a dinner restaurant since reservations can only be made after check-in, but the staff was kind and accommodating. The beach just past the resort was bustling with volleyball nets, hair braiders, jewelry vendors, hammocks, and more. The sunrises and sunsets were gorgeous from the spot this resort has on the beach.</dd>

			 		<dd>Grand Velas is considered a more luxurious resort than the others, so the price point is higher. When we checked in, we got a free head massage and a welcome drink, which was fantastic because the check-in process was lengthy. The landscaping was flawless, all the rooms faced the ocean, and the service was fantastic. My parents said wonderful things about the spa services, which were an additional cost but evidently worth it. The restaurants here were our favorite of all the resorts. This resort will always be a favorite.</dd>

					<dd>This resort was huge. There were many more restaurants, bars, and pools than the others, including a waterpark section. Maps were available, but carts that could fit six more people often took so long that we just walked. The shops were great, though overpriced (which is to be expected). While we did enjoy our stay, my whole family agrees that this was our least favorite resort mostly because of its size and crowdedness.</dd>

				<h5>Transportation</h5>
				<p>This is one of the factors that I always recommend researching. Not every resort will be on the beach or very close to shopping in town (which can be sketchy). The distance from the airport also varies, and when you arrive, there will be a crowd of people trying to get you to choose their transportation option. Now, your resort may be able to help you arrange for a taxi or car service during your stay, but getting there from the airport should be your main concern. Here are some tips from my dad:</p>
				  <ul>
				  <li>Look at reviews and compare prices of transportation companies.</li>
				  <li>Make some calls. The companies that are the most responsive and have real people answering the phone are your best bet.</li>
				  <li>Book about one week in advance, though they usually can fit you in within a few days of your arrival.</li>
				  <li>Again, make sure the reviews you find are real with thorough information about the quality of the cars and the experience.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you're looking for tours or activities like whale watching, many of these same tips apply. Your resort will likely have brochures or even a help center where you can explore your options and ask questions.</p>

				<h5>Packing Tips</h5>
				<ul>
				  <li>Check the weather, either through a weather app or a quick Internet search about the typical climate, and plan accordingly. I've never experienced rain in Mexico, but I pack a sweatshirt and tennis shoes every time.</li>
				  <li>On the resorts' websites, find the dress code for the restaurants. Many don't allow casual clothing, but you don't have to bring your fanciest gowns. I also recommend carrying cash for tips.</li>
				  <li>If you'd like, coordinate with your fellow travelers to plan your outfits so that they don't clash in photos.</li>
				  <li>Bring as many swimsuits as there are days&mdash;unless your trip is on the longer side, in which case I would plan on rewearing some.</li>
				  <li>Don't forget the Hawaiian shirts, cover-ups, sunglasses, slides, and beach bag for the pool.</li>
				  <li>Buy your sunscreen before your trip if you can, because it gets pricey at the resorts and they may not have the brand you like.</li>
				  <li>My family loves playing games, so we bring a few decks of playing cards and often Skull King and Tapped Four.</li>
				  <li>Other items include books, a sun hat, watershoes, and more depending on your intended activities.</li>
				  <li>And don't forget your PASSPORT!</li>

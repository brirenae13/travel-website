				<h5>Origin Story</h5>
				<p>I stumbled upon this particular destination after my dad encouraged me to look into study abroad programs while I could, and boy am I glad I did. My roommate and I made an impulse decision to apply to the BYU London Centre Study Abroad only a day or two before the deadline; though we were bummed she didn't get in, I decided to go through with it anyway, feeling that I would regret it if I didn't.</p>
				<p>There are so many fantastic things about this program, though it definitely had its ups and downs. We drove all over England and even flew over to Ireland and Northern Ireland for a week. Students were given the option to travel to Wales, Scotland, or anywhere else in England towards the end of the semester as long as we got the trip approved (Student Travel Week). Everyone was required to take 12 of the 15 credits offered by the faculty directing the program that particular semester&mdash;yes, the faculty and classes offered change with each semester. Keep scrolling to see our itinerary and more!</p>

				  <li>Borough Market: Famous spot for food and goodies, but overpriced and overhyped in my opinion. Still good.</li>

				  <li>Chicken Shop: Like Raising Canes, but without the sauce. We were fairly impressed.</li>
				  <li>Nando's</li>

				<h5>Study Abroad Logistics</h5>
				<p>This section is specifically about the program during the semester I went. If you're not looking into a study abroad here or through one of BYU's programs, feel free to skip this section, but there may still be some valuable information.</p>
				<p>PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: DO NOT TRY TO VISIT THE LONDON CENTRE IF YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM. Meaning, even students who have done a program here in the past can't ever go inside again. Students cannot open the door for anyone, and professors and staff can only let in people that are supposed to be there, for privacy and safety reasons.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Two semesters before the study abroad, everyone was required to take the prep class. It was held on campus at BYU, but for me and others who were too far away to attend in-person, a Zoom option was available. It was only half a semester and fairly easy (1 credit). This is the perfect opportunity to ask questions about the program, too.</li>
				  <li>From what I’ve heard, other study abroad programs are typically $30k or more. The base price of mine was $11,600, which included tuition, transportation, housing, some food, and planned group activities like plays and museum tickets. On top of that, my flights to and from the U.S. totaled about $1,600, and I spent about $3,000 on food, souvenirs, plays, toiletries, and other random things.</li>
				  <li>Students from any university and religious denomination can apply, but those who get in must agree to and follow the <a href="https://policy.byu.edu/view/church-educational-system-honor-code" target="_blank">BYU Honor Code</a>. Church attendance is required. Curfew is not a joke, but rather a safety issue; if you know you're going to be out past it, just let the faculty know, preferably ahead of time if you're going to a concert or other event. Always travel in a group of three or more&mdash;this is another safety rule.</li>
				  <li>Bedrooms in the London Centre have varying number of beds: 1, 4, 6, 12, and 14. Closet space is very limited; they're more like tall lockers. The bathrooms have decent space, but the shower doors aren't cloudy enough to competely hide the people inside them (thankfully, you'll only ever be roomed with your same sex).</li>
				  <li>Classes take place in the London Centre's classroom, or sometimes even inside museums.</li>
				  <li>Students are required to help out in the kitchen and servery on their assigned weeks. This wasn't our favorite, but it helps keep the cost down instead of paying for more staff.</li>
				  <li>The laundry situation is not ideal: all 41 students had to take turns using 3 washers and 3 dryers in the basement. I recommend bringing or buying some sort of bag to haul your laundry up and down the many stairs.</li>
				  <li>We received a Google Doc that detailed the daily itinerary for the entire trip, which was super convenient.</li>
				  <li>We traveled very cheaply because our group was so large: 41 students plus the 3 professors and their families totaled 52 people. We did have mishaps, especially on our Ryan Air flight to Ireland.</li>
				  <li>We were limited to one checked bag, one carry-on suitcase, and one backpack. I overpacked, regretted it, and left some clothing there. Remember that you'll have many opportunities to shop for souvenirs, including clothes!</li>

				<h5>Other Suggestions and Packing Tips</h5>
				  <p>Here are some things you may want to think about as you pack and research for England or its neighboring countries.</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>I highly recommend getting a credit card with no international fees before traveling to London. For shorter trips, you can get away with just using cash to avoid extra fees, but if you ever use the Tube for transportation, you have to tap your card to get in and out. Since my program was three and a half months, getting a credit card without international fees made my life so much easier, even though I had an Oyster card for the Tube.</li>
					<li>Unless you plan to download every route you plan on taking around London, I suggest looking into an international phone plan for the duration of your stay. Google Maps is your friend&mdash;but only when it can connect to the Internet.</li>
					<li>Oyster cards themselves are not cheap, and you still have to load money on them on top of that to actually use them for the Tube. This expense was included in the program cost, so the faculty managed that purchase and the balances on the cards based on how much we needed to travel. If you decide to get one, DON'T LOSE IT.</li>
					<li>Learn about the Tube before you go! I had no idea what I was doing when I left Heathrow Airport on the Elizabeth line. I'm still shocked I didn't get lost. By the second month, we were pros at navigating the underground system.</li>
					<li>Find some good walking shoes, and do it well before your trip. If you intend to stay mostly in downtown London and want to match its aesthetic, consider bringing a pair that are dressier. I wished I would have brought dressier clothes once I saw the typical fashion (it's not jeans).</li>
					<li>To see exactly how much money I'd be spending on my purchases, I got the app "My Currency Converter" (it's yellow). During my trip, one British pound was equivelant to $1.34. Doesn't seem like much, but it adds up quick&mdash;see the second bullet point under "Study Abroad Logistics".</li>
					<li>Budget properly for expensive food, or else resign yourself to mediocre meal deals.</li>
					<li>Bring travel shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. The hotels and especially hostels I stayed at did not have any, and I didn't find a single store that sold travel-sized anything.</li>
					<li>Speaking of, UK grocery stores are tiny, so lower your American expectations.</li>
					<li>It didn't rain very much during our semester there, but it's always a good idea to bring a rainjacket, waterproof shoes, and an umbrella.</li>
					<li>Bring bags that work for overnight trips and week-long trips.</li>
					<li>And don't forget to bring your PASSPORT!</li>

	  	  <h5>The OG Travel Group</h5>
      	  <p>Our family of six is fortunate enough to have traveled together on many occasions. While most of our trips have been stateside, the real chaos happens on our international trips&mdash;and I wouldn't have it any other way. Some of my most favorite memories come from both the hilarious and the sentimental moments of our adventures together.</p>

          <h5>The Best Trio Ever</h5>
	 	  <p>I met these two on the first day of our study abroad program. We became fast friends in Borough Market and spent almost every moment of the trip together, from double-decker rides to museum visits to countless photoshoots. Though I sometimes wish I were extroverted, people like them remind me that great connections are always about quality over quantity.</p>

          <h5>Why Prepare Intellectually?</h5>
	 	  <p>The locations I was most excited about seeing were the places I knew the most about beforehand. I distinctly remember reading parts of Ancient Egyptian history with my mom back in elementary school, and reading many Ancient Greek myths as part of my literature studies naturally put Greece by Egypt at the top of my bucket list. If studying before a trip feels too off-putting, though, I recommend choosing your destination based on histories you're already familiar with. </p>

			  <h5>The Ancient Tradition Podcast</h5>
				</a>
			  <p>My mom found and shared this fantastic podcast that dives into ancient records to find whether there is evidence of a single theology given to humankind by God. The host, a scholar who goes by Jack Logan, analyses stubborn details and symbols in countless ancient texts that hold deep meaning. I've listened to it three times in the past couple years, which has made visiting museums and landmarks infinitely more exciting. If you're wondering why I chose a tree as the picture, there's a reason&mdash;click on the title of this paragraph and explore <em>The Ancient Tradition</em> for yourself.</p>

				<p>I'm building an Instagram account to document my travels through aesthetic reels. Though, I don't intend on trying my hand at the influencer life; my goal is to share useful, realistic details about meaningful traveling (while increasing my content design skills).
